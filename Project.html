                    <p>Our problem statement is based on the theme AI in Spam Detection and deals with how the mails we receive are classified as spam or not and prevents important mails to be reported spam. So, we feel that the solution to this problem can be a proper analysis from the spam reporter involving specific questions pointing towards what words or sentences made them question the sender’s intent to be able to categorize emails correctly.</p>
